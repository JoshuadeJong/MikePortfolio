The student has made great progress not only in his skill as a guitarist, but also his musicianship. I cannot recommend Mike enough.

I'd been learning on my own for a year or so before reaching out to him, and I saw immediate and consistent improvements even after the very first lesson. The things I used to struggle a great deal with are barely afterthoughts anymore thanks to him. He doesn't just know what he's talking about; he'll make sure that you do, too.",

        text: "Mike is simply an incredible teacher. He was quick to find where I was at skill wise and then found creative ways to push me to achieve even more than I set out to. He provided weekly practice suggestions and assignments that were all tailored to my growth as a guitarist. In the year I worked with Mike I went from just knowing basic guitar chords, to confidently being able to accompany myself, play solos, and to learn songs mostly by ear. Mike is the type of teacher that inspires you to practice because he clearly explains how each exercise contributes to your growth and how you can use it in a practical scenario. Overall I highly recommends guitar lessons with Mike.",

I’ve been playing guitar for years before I met Mike, but I had always felt like I didn’t know to get better on my own. Mike has helped me improve more in one year than I have the entire time I’ve played by myself. Mike is really good at helping you break down music that you like and teaching you the important things you need to know to incorporate the style into your own playing. Highly recommend him as a teacher!",

His easy-going style makes lessons fun and encouraging. Through these lessons I’ve learned proper guitar basics, chords, finger picking, various songs, soloing, and some music theory. The results really speak for themselves. Mike is an extremely impressive musician and impactful teacher. Would highly recommend!",

While studying under him I discovered my love for guitar and jazz music and he opened my eyes to the wide array of possibilities of artistry and self expression that had such a profound impact on me that I decided to go to berklee college of music to pursue a carrer in jazz. Mike has served as a mentor for me in this process and I dont know what I would be today without his influence on my life. Mike is an amazing person and could not recommend taking lessons from him enough.",
