    about: [
        "My name is Michael Eskenazi, I'm a professional guitarist working in the industry since 2012. After Graduation from Ballard High School in Seattle, Washington I was offered a scholarship to New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, and moved to New York City to pursue music.",
        "During my time in New York I studied with and was mentored by some of the finest musicians this planet has to offer. Some of those musicians include: Bruce Edwards, Charles Tolliver, Jimmy Owens, Vic Juris, Ed Cherry and Onaje Allan Gumbs, all of whom helped shape and mold my musical outlook and style.",
        "I gained a great amount of professional musical experience while in New York City playing everywhere from churches, private parties, weddings, festivals, jazz clubs and everything in between. Playing in such a wide variety of settings has helped me to be able to fit the needs of what ever musical setting I find myself in and how to sustain myself as a musician making a living in a place with the most talented and abundant amount of musicians in the world. I was also employed as a teacher at the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music and the Fred Astaire Dance studio.",
        "I am currently residing in the Seattle area where I am an active teacher and a core member of Gary Hammons group Last Of The Tribe."

            "Teaching is one of my passions! Molding to your learning style is valuable and effective. Too often I see musicians focused on teaching the instrument in hand versus encompassing the overall principles of learning music. I incorporate a holistic approach by teaching the basic elements of music, including but not limited to: ear training, rhythm, tone, dynamics and harmony.",
            "Learning music is more than becoming familiar with an instrument. It instills discipline, ignites the creative mind and develops an outlet for expression that can stay with you for a lifetime. My primary goal as a teacher is to share and nurture these benefits with every aspiring musician I meet.",
            "I work with students of all ages and levels, including children as young as 5 years old. I offer in person for local clients, and zoom meetings for those who prefer it.",
            "I look forward to working with you and exploring the joy of creating music together. Let's start with a brief meeting to get to know you, student and parent if applicable, and learn more about your goals as a musician."
