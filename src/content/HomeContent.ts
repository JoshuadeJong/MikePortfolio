        "I grew up around music and I think I was always interested in it from a young age. Nobody in my family played music but my dad is a huge music lover. Though he wasn’t a musician himself, he went to Franklin High School in the 1970s when the Franklin Jazz Lab was great, and most of his friends played music. Some of them went on to be professional musicians and became influences in my life. So, I grew up listening to all the great funk, R&B, and soul music of the 70s. When I started playing music, I got really into the blues and Jimi Hendrix. But after about three years, I wanted to expand my horizons. I was reading an interview in Guitar Player magazine with Vernon Reid, of Living Colour, one of my favorite guitarists. He talked about being influenced by Eric Dolphy and Charles Mingus. So, the next day I left school early, went to Easy Street Records in Seattle, and bought Out to Lunch and Mingus Ah Um. Pretty much forward from there, I was obsessed with jazz.",
        "I was going to Ballard High School at the time, in my senior year, I decided to join the jazz band. Gary Hammon taught saxophone there and he ended up being a huge musical influence for me, and one of my best friends. I would skip class and just talk to him about music for hours. He ended up giving me one of my first gigs and some of the most valuable musical advice I’ve ever gotten. We have been playing together ever since. He also encouraged me to go and study in New York.

I would highly, highly recommend working with him if you're looking to improve.",
